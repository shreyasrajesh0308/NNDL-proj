# NNDL-project

Authors : Shreyas, Sid, Paul, Nithin. 

**TASK** : Time series classification, the goal is to look at BCI data and classify the data into 4 possible classes. Each unit of data has 22 sensor data with 1000 time steps for each. 

1. Project Data contains parsed and cleaned data. 
2. Check out the the Data and project python notebook for an overview of the project plan and some basic analysis of provided Data. 
3. Please update the same notebook as and when there are any updates to the project. 


The following experiments are underway:

1. (Baseline) CNN model: Model as in [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.06455). A keras implementation can be found [here](https://keras.io/examples/timeseries/timeseries_classification_from_scratch/). Test Accuracy: 0.46000000834465027
